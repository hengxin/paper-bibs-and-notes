\section{Specification} \label{section:spec}

\bib{\bibentry{CM:DC1995}}
\note{\it The original definition of causal memory with respect to read-write registers.
It also contains a classic implementation using vector clocks,
which is, however, not fault-tolerant.}

\bib{\bibentry{CC:PPoPP2016}}
\note{\it This paper discusses three variants of causal consistency,
namely $\dots$.}

\bib{\bibentry{SessionGuarantees:PDIS1994}}
\note{\it This paper disusses four session guarantees (RYW, MR, WFR, MW) and their implementations.}

\bib{\bibentry{SessionCausality:PDP2004}}
\note{\it This paper discusses relationship between session guarantees and causal consistency.}
