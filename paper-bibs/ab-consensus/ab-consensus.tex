\note{\it 
  Paxos, Viewstamped Replication, and Zab are replication protocols 
  for high-availability in asynchronous environments with crash failures.
  Claims have been made about their similarities and differences.
  But how does one determine whether two protocols are the same, 
  and if not, how significant are the differences? 
  We address these questions using refinement mappings.

\note{\it
  In this paper, we present a formal mapping between Raft and Paxos, 
  and use this knowledge to port a certain class of optimizations from Paxos to Raft.
